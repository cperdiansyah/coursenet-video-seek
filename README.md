# HTML Video Player Control Hijack

I joined the coruse on the "Course Net" platform, but because I was bored with the fundamental video I tried to seek forward but couldn't. Luckily on the console bar, finding a console warning video seek is not allowed, so I'm trying to find a way so that the video can seek forward and it works

This method should work on all platforms that use HTML Video Player as their Video Player. Use it wisely, I made this because I have a hard time seeking backward to jot down important stuff but can't seeking forward to getting back to where it was
